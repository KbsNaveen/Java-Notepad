{"name":"Java-notepad","tagline":"A Portable Notepad, developed in java, with all the basic features.","body":"### Welcome to Java-Notepad Project Page.\r\nThis is a small java project to create a editor with all the basic features. Since the editor is developed in java it runs on any platform(Portable).\r\n\r\n### Download and try running\r\nDownload the project in either of the formats available(zip or tar ball) and extract the files to a folder, say Java-Notepad.\r\n\r\n### Running\r\nYou can run the project in two ways.\r\n* From the terminal( or console or command line or command prompt) \r\n* Using eclipse\r\n\r\n### Running from console\r\nOpen terminal or command prompt in the folder extracted(Java-Notepad).\r\nIf you don't know how to do it, here it is:\r\n```\r\ncd <Path to the folder(Java-Notepad)>\r\n```\r\nType that at the prompt, replacing \"<Path to the folder(Java-Notepad)>\" with actual path to the folder extracted.\r\n\r\nNow compile and run the project by typing the below commands:\r\n```\r\nmkdir bin\r\njavac -d bin src\\*.java\r\njava -cp bin StartJNotePad\r\n```\r\nAs soon as you type the last command you will see editor starting up.\r\n\r\n### Running Using Eclipse\r\nEclipse is one of the popular IDEs for java development. So you might already be using it for developing java codes. I added the required support files to open up the project in eclipse. All you need to do is to import the project into eclipse. If you don't know how to do it follow the below steps.\r\n\r\n```\r\n* Fire up(or start) Eclipse.\r\n* Click on File -> Import\r\n* In the Import dialog box, type \"Existing project\" in the textbox\r\n  (or) expand general and select \"Existing Projects into Workspace\".\r\n* Click Next.\r\n* Select the root directory by browsing to the folder extracted(Java-Notepad).\r\n* Click Finish. Eclipse will load the project.\r\n```\r\n\r\nOnce the project is loaded into eclipse workspace, click on the run button to run the project. That's it you will see the editor starting up. (Select \"Java Application\" if you see any dialog box asking the \"Run as\" type of the applicaion.)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
